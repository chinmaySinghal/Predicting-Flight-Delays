# Predicting-Flight-Delays
Predictive modelling project for the Introduction to Data Science class taught by Prof. Brian d'Alessandro at NYU.

<h2>About</h2>
Every year almost 23% of the domestic flights in the United States are delayed or cancelled due to various reasons, costing huge sums of dollars to both the airlines and travellers in lost time and money. So, the aim was to model departure delays for flights departing from the JFK airport using historical data obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), US Department of Transportation along with past weather data and US Bank holidays data. Various supervised classification algorithms were tried and the best AUC of 0.78 was acheived using ensemble methods.<br><br>
