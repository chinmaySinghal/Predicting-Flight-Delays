# Predicting-Flight-Delays
Every year almost 23% of the domestic flights in the United States are delayed or cancelled due to various reasons, costing huge sums of dollars to both the airlines and travellers in lost time and money. This means that over half of the cost is borne by the passengers due to flight delays, cancellations and missed connections. The cost to airlines includes increased expenses on the crew, fuel, and maintenance, among others. So in order to save both the airlines and the travellers from facing such a precarious situation, the aim is to model flight departure delays for flights departing from the JFK airport using historical data obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), US Department of Transportation along with past weather data and US Bank holidays data. Various supervised classification algorithms were tried and the best AUC of 0.78 was acheived using ensemble methods.<br><br>
